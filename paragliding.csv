"A method of launching a hang glider.  In this method, the pilot and glider are attached via a tow rope to the back of an ultralight aircraft.  The ultralight tows the pilot into the sky and the pilot releases himself and his glider from the tow rope at a predetermined altitude or when given a visual signal from the pilot of the ultralight.  This method is very advantageous as the pilot can release while he is in the middle of lift.

"Flex Wing -  A hang glider as originally based on the designs of Francis Rogallo.  A flex wing glider consists of an internal frame of aircraft aluminum alloy tubing, (held together by AN bolts, plates and stainless steel aircraft cables).  The main parts of the frame include - two leading edge tubes (left and right), as well as two cross tubes, (sometimes also referred to as cross bars or cross spars) and a central keel tube. These structural members are sometimes located inside a very strong, yet flexible, Dacron® polyester or similar light weight composite fabric “sail”.  Pilot input is given by way of a , located below the main airframe. Together, these components create a highly unique yet basic aircraft capable of being controlled simply by the shifting of the pilot’s weight from side to side, or front to back.  The flexibility of the frame and sail combination allow for this simple mode of control.  This, in turn,  allows the pilot a very direct feel of, and connection with, the air through which she or he flies.  Piloting a flexwing hang glider is probably the closest a person can come to actually being a bird.

The sport is closely related to paragliding and gliding (flying sailplanes) but usually using a (much simpler and less expensive (out)) craft often consisting of an aluminum- or composite-framed fabric wing, with the pilot mounted on a harness hanging from the wing frame and exercising control by shifting body weight; there are alternatives to such arrangements and choices of materials. Sport categories have evolved where complex and expensive systems may also be used.

"Rigid Wing – A high aspect ratio hang glider which, due to its more traditional aircraft-like rigid frame and airfoil, utilizes (more) conventional control surfaces to change its attitude and direction of flight. Rigid wing hang gliders offer significant advantages in performance over flex wings, and are much better at tasks such as cross country flying.  However, they achieve these improvements at the cost of greater structural complexity, higher weight, and a less intuitive method of pilot control.  They also cost noticeably more than flex wing hang gliders.  Rigid wing hang gliders are, in a way, a bridge between flex wing hang gliders and traditional aviation’s sail planes.

"A glider where the fabric forms the airfoil.  Single surface gliders are typically, ,, light-in-weight, easy-to-fly, lower-in-performance, and are suitable-for-all-pilots gliders. Technically, a wing that is of the thickness of just a single fabric layer has become known as SS; acturally there is still a top surface and an lower surface to that single fabric. The airfoil of a SS glider (HG or PG) is thus super thin. In distinction, when the airfoil is thicker, then the lower surface shape becomes distinct from the shape of the upper surface where double-surface (DS, DSHG, DSPG) is then a term used. Notice that a SSHG is potentially a high-performance machine requiring expert piloting for a minimum. SS gliders historically have ranged from safe to unsafe, from low cost to high cost. The 1972 Roy Haggard SS flexible-wing hang glider at the Turkey Fly was with a very taut sail, low wing loading, and perhaps no diver-recovery reflexing; such was in its moment a very excellent glider for guarded flying, but not suitable for just ""most pilots."" The Rogallo limp wing single-surface parawing and Barish Sailwing have been used for paragliding; the Domina Jalbert double-surface thick ram-air airfoil is the most popular DS wing used for paragliders. [Recall that in early 1960s ""paraglider"" was used for the framed flexible wing hang glider; but as the Barish leadership developed foot launch limp-wing compression-member-less canopy hang gliding, the term ""paraglider"" began to be reserved for the generally rigid-frame-less string-controlled hang glider; today, the bifurcation persists. Designers still recognize that a continuum potential exists from no compression members to fully solid forms; and a potential for mixed control patterns from string-only control through hybrids of string-and-frame control to frame-only control designs.]  SS gliders may take airfoil shapes via various mechanisms: shaped leading edge members, shaped ribs, shaped battens, shaped appliques, holds from exterior wires.  In some sport events SSHGs form a class with an implication that one is probably using a product from a manufacturer dubbed SS. Also , (SSW) is sometimes used.  Very-thin constant-thickness airfoils (though mechanically having a top surface and a lower surfaced) has been seen popularly as SS.

"This is a complicated subject, but there is an optimum speed to fly for any combination of sinking/lifting air and wind speed/direction. ""Optimum"" here means furthest glide over the ground. A sophisticated flight computer, with information from a GPS, can compute the wind speed. The flight computer itself measures the lift or sink. Knowing the glider's performance characteristics, the computer can tell the pilot what speed he should fly at to maximize his glide.

"The triangle control frame in some hang gliders consists of tow side beams approximately meeting at their upper ends near the wing's root chord or keel; the two side beams's lower ends usually hold between them a basebar (trapeze bar, control bar, speedbar, belly basebar, etc.). The two down beams (legs, downtubes, uptubes, queenposts, etc.)and the basebar form a geometric triangle roughly. The TCF generally needs staying its position by struts or cables that communicate with the hang glider's other airframe parts. 
","Triangle control frame (TCF)
"
"The TCF cable-stayed with hang glider pilot behind the TCF was photographed and fact in a hang glider within a Breslau territory gliding club in the year 1908. We still use such TCF in many hang gliders of today. 
",
"Just as a geometric triangle has its degenerate instances, so the TCF has known its degenerate instances; one important degenerate TCF is where the two downtubes meet so closely that they become one (while either the basebar or control bar becomes a tee formation in some aircraft or simply becomes a stub or even identical to the end of the downbeam; this format is the age-old control beam or control stick that exchanges strut staying or cable staying with rigid staying to the wing itself; see Benson gyrocopter hang glider for such instance; another before 1930 was the Spratt use of the cable-stayed TCF; another is in the Paresev 1961c hang gliders.  A degenerated TCF was instructed in the 1887 Beeson US Patent hang glider. 
",
"When skilled designers began to explore power, the TCF structure and understood mechanics got morphed to holding takeoff and landing wheels while also acting as two queenposts in some instances. In hundreds of different aircraft before 1920, one can identify such mechanics regarding the TCF structure. Even the William Beeson 1887 preempted the Wanner and the NASA flexible wing hang glider flows. Spratt also used the known TCF arts.  After 50 years of evident instructions on many formats of the TCF, one finds some mid-century use by NASA, Barry Hill Palmer, Mike Burns, and then later others like Dickenson who had experience directly already with the gyrocopter degenerate TCF from the Benson flow.   
",
"Actually, the mechanics of the TCF is found in the staying of pendulumed variable-positioned weights of the early 1800s Walker gliders. Wenham in the 1800s text and drawings indicated understanding of the TCF arts.   Notes on TCF are welcome to be shared at notes@HangGliderHistory.com       For instance, the hybrid hang glider by Tony Prentice at his age 13 years had a framed wing and cord-only control where the TCF was all cord format staying in tension during lift-off; see LIFT in 2010 for Tony's drawings and notes.

" This organization had a brief life, as the owner then gave the name over via a non-competition agreement to the later being-born United States Hang Gliding Association, which see next:
,The ,.  The name has changed to USHPA to include an emphasis on the string-controlled hang gliders recent decades called paragliders in addition to frame-controlled hang gliders often abbreviated to ""hang gliders."" Both the string-controlled and the frame-controlled hang glders are mechanically hang gliders. The FAI also respects that paragliders are a proper subset within the parent set of ""hang gliders.""    Note too that the Paresev hang gliders with framed four-boom collapsibility in 1961 were indeed dubbed ""paragliders"" in contra-distinction to how that term has become identified with string-controlled limp wings with nearly no compression members in the wing canopy. There still is a chance that the market will one day move into robust stiffening of paraglider canopies by various means (beams, whiskers, inflated beams, smart-triggering limp-to-stiff-to-limp sails, etc. to fill out a near continuum of flexibility-stiffness for hang gliders.

"Higher-performing gliders have the capability for the pilot to change their geometry while in flight. The pilot pulls on a cord to tighten the sail, and releases it to loosen the sail. A tight sail makes for a better glide, but makes the glider harder to control. Therefore, (roughly speaking) we use a loose VG setting while working thermals, and a tight VG setting while crossing areas of sink in search of the next thermal.   
,A second region of variable geometry regards morphing wing shapes via variable extension, variable porosity, variable reefing, etc. Mid-1900s deployments of hang glider sails facing some of these morphing tactics. The future will see even more efforts in morphable wings for hang gliders.
