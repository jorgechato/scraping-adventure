"Neoprene is the DuPont Performance Elastomers trade name for a family of synthetic rubbers based on polychloroprene (polymer form of Chloroprene). For diving and exposure protection applications, the air spaces in the neoprene are filled with nitrogen for its insulation value. Thick wet-suits made at the extreme end of their cold-water protection are usually made of 7mm thick neoprene. It should be noted that since neoprene contains many porous air-spaces, the material compresses the further underwater its exposed too. So a 7mm neoprene wet suit offers much less exposure protection under one hundred feet of water than at the surface. A new advance in neoprene for wet-suits has been the ""super-flex"" variety which combines spandex into the neoprene for a greater flexibility.",Neoprene
